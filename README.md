NYC Population is about 8.5 million, and approximately 37% of the population consist of immigrants. Our team are all immigrants and we share similar experiences. Our parents did not have many resources available when they first arrived here, not to mention that they were not used to the technology of the time.

When we researched apps to try and solve this problem, we found that they were scattered all over. They’re hard to navigate through and they are quite expensive. There are no apps that provide information regarding Legal Services office phone numbers, or Reading & Writing Center phone numbers, or even GED program and Domestic Violence Center locations for immigrants. That’s why we came up with ImmiGuide, a mobile application that provides support to immigrants at their fingertips!
